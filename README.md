# Trinity Fusion

What if General AI didn’t have to be centralized?  
What if cognition could emerge — not from one massive brain — but from many loosely connected parts?

**Trinity Fusion** is a radical exploration of decentralized, modular AGI.  
Built on the idea that intelligence can be assembled, not monolithically trained.

## What is This?

This is a minimal prototype — not a complete system.  
No APIs, no interfaces, no layers of abstraction — just a glimpse into the core concept.

Think of this as:
- A conversation starter  
- A playground for abstract cognitive modeling  
- A foundation for future experimental development

## Core Concept

Trinity Fusion splits cognition into three functional modules:
1. **Logic** — rule-based reasoning  
2. **Emotion** — affective filtering and nuance  
3. **Instinct** — heuristic learning and rapid decision-making

Each module functions independently, with minimal interdependence.  
The intelligence arises not from one part, but from the interaction — the fusion — of the three.

## Minimal Prototype

This repository includes a raw, minimal prototype demonstrating how the fusion concept might be implemented in code.
